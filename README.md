Project made following Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller Angular2+ course on Udemy [https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/]()

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Firebase

To make this project work with Firebase, configure the environment classes located at: 
_src/environments/environment.ts_ and _src/environments/environment.prod.ts_ files.

You need to set the URL to your firebase project as well as the domain and the API key.

__IMPORTANT:__ if you plan to republish this project on a public repository, remember not to publish your personal firebase configuration!
Add the environment you plan to use in a .gitignore file or set the enviroment files to '--assume-unchanged'! 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
